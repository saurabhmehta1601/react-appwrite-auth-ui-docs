### Project Structure

#### Pages

Our App consists of 3 pages 

1. `SigninPage` : This page will be used to sign in the user with email and password.

2. `SignupPage` : This page will be used to sign up the user with email and password.

3. `Homepage` : This page will be used to show the list of positive quotes to the user.

#### Components 

The components used in our app are :

1. `Header`: This component will be used to show the header of our app. This component will show sign out to user if user is logged in else it will show sign in .

2. `Quotes`: This component will be used to show the list of quotes to the user. This component will be rendered on Homepage if user is logged in else not .
